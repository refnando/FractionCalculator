## Fraction Calculator

This is a command-line program that performs operations on fractions and provides the result in fractional form. The program supports the following legal operators: `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), `+` (add), and `-` (subtract).

### Usage

To use the Fraction Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Run the program in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Enter a valid fraction operation using the supported operators and operands.
3. Make sure to separate operands and operators by one or more spaces.
4. Mixed numbers should be represented as `whole_numerator/denominator`, e.g., "3_1/4".
5. The program will process the input and display the result in fractional form.

### Supported Operations

The Fraction Calculator allows you to perform operations on fractions, improper fractions, and whole numbers using the supported operators.

Examples of valid operations:

- `3/4 + 1/2`
- `5/8 - 1/4`
- `2/3 * 3/5`
- `1/2 / 3/4`
- `2_3/4 + 1/4`
- `5 * 2/3`

### Notes

- The program will display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs, such as incorrect operation format, unknown operators, badly formed fractions, and invalid operands.
- Make sure to enter the input in the correct format as described above to get accurate results.

Feel free to use this Fraction Calculator to perform arithmetic with fractions easily and efficiently!
